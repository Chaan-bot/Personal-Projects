Hi this is some personal and degree projects I've completed. The file structure will define the technologies and each obviously works different when downloading/viewing. 

The structure is currently as follows:

## C++

1) Trading Bot - Works with non-real world data , makes use of algortihms to attempt to maximize profit. 
2) Juce DJAPP - Requires Juce on local machine , uses library to create a DJ board with some functionalities such as looping , mixing , volume control etc.
