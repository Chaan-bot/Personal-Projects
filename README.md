### Data Science 

1) Data Science regarding cars and their various different features. Aims to evaluate if there is linear regression between cars and some of their features.
   
2) Football data research. The project aims to instantiate the difference between modern day and earlier football playstyles by viewing team stats on different timelines. 

### Machine / Deep Learning 

1) Deep Learning on a public dataset - A project that attempts to find the optimal neural network word image classification , specifically recyclable and non recyclable items. 

2) Wine Coursework - University project to implement machine learning practises and algorithms on a wine dataset (code written myself).

## React.js

1) React Quiz - A react project that fetches questions from a locally hosted API and uses useReducer hook.

2) Travel List - A very basic list/checkbox react page.
